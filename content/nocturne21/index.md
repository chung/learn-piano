### Chapter 3

# Chopin Nocturne No.21

This is the last nocturne in [the list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnes_(Chopin)). Written in C minor, it is one of those piano pieces that [once heard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIqx0MOsNfo), you definitely have to try to [learn and play](https://musescore.com/classicman/scores/67216) it.

It has 44 measures, shorter than the [moonlight mvt.1](/moonlight). However, it is more difficult. And we don't have the Express Stave version, so let's use the [official music sheet](chopin-nocturne21.pdf). It is not too bad!
