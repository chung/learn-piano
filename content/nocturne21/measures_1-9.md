We will translate from the [original scores](chopin-nocturne21.pdf) to base 12 numbers. As with many other Chopin pieces, we will practice left hand (LH) first. Measure 1 has just one note, so we will start from measure 2.

Then right hand(RH):

_measure 3 (RH)_

Only after each hand can play adequately, then we practice hand together (HT).

And continue with measure 4 & 5 left hand:

_measure 4 (LH)_ very similar with _measure 3 (LH)_:

Then the right hand:

_measure 4 (RH)_

_measure 5 (RH)_

The first 12 notes of _measure 5 (RH)_ are actually played against the 4 eight notes in the left hand. But it should not be a problem. It is not [_polyrhythm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm) yet.

Measures 6-8 are exact duplicates of measures 2-4, so we will skip them here.

That is it, with many duplicates, this section is not that hard. Next section will begin with the last octave G (2G-3G) of _measure 9_.
