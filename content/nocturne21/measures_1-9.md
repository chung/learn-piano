We will translate from the [original scores](chopin-nocturne21.pdf) to base 12 numbers. As with many other Chopin pieces, we will practice left hand (LH) first. Measure 1 has just one note, so we will start from measure 2.

_measure 2 (LH)_

Then right hand(RH):


_measure 1-2 (RH)_
~~~~
3G  44   46 47   49 4G    4G
~~~~

_measure 3 (RH)_
~~~~
4X   4G 52 50   4G 44
~~~~

Only after each hand can play adequately, then we practice hand together (HT). And continue with measure 4 & 5 left hand:

_measure 4 (LH)_ very similar with _measure 3 (LH)_:

        37              36
1G  2G  34  2G  1G  2G  33  2G

Then the right hand:

_measure 4 (RH)_
~~~~
46   3g 42 40   3g 3g    44

_measure 5 (RH)_

44 46 44 43 44 46 47 48 49 4x 50 4g 46

The first 12 notes of _measure 5 (RH)_ are actually played against the 4 eight notes in the left hand. But it should not be a problem. It is not [_polyrhythm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm) yet.

Measures 6-8 are exact duplicates of measures 2-4, so we will skip them here.

_measure 9 (LH)_ = _measure 4 (LH)_:

That is it, with many duplicates, this section is not that hard. Next section will begin with the last note G (3g) of _measure 9_.
