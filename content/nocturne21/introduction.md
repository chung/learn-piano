In the [previous chapter](/moonlight/), we learnt to play the _moonlight_ using just [numbers](/basics/mapping-piano-keys). It is fine because most notes in that piece are of equal length. For this nocturne, we need to learn to read traditional sheet music. There are many [resources](http://takelessons.com/blog/reading-piano-notes) on the Internet. Go ahead and [read them](http://www.musicnotes.com/blog/2014/04/11/how-to-read-sheet-music/). And now I will assume you know the basic stuff.
