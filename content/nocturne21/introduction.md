In the [previous chapter](/moonlight/), we learnt to play the _moonlight_ using just [numbers](/basics/mapping-piano-keys). It is fine because most notes in that piece are of equal length. For this nocturne, we need to learn to read traditional sheet music. There are many [resources](http://takelessons.com/blog/reading-piano-notes) on the Internet. Go ahead and [read them](http://www.musicnotes.com/blog/2014/04/11/how-to-read-sheet-music/). And now I will assume you know the basic stuff.

[Nocturnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne) are short music composition that historically performed at night. Even though Chopin was not the originator of nocturne, he is widely considered the most famous composer of the form. Chopin wrote [21 of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnes_(Chopin)). This is the [last piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne_in_C_minor,_Op._posth._(Chopin)) in that list. I really like the beautiful melody played by the right hand and the simple accompaniment on the left hand.

Since it is very song-like and quite short (44 measures), we will just divide it into small chunks of measures for convenient learning.
