The introduction lasts 4 measures. It is a good idea to listen to the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7_IZPHHb0) again to familiarize with the melody.

#### measure 1

This is easy to play, the right hand (RH) just plays 3 notes 30-35-38 (triplet) 4 times evenly with slow tempo. Left hand (LH) just plays octave C#: 15-25 and holds them down. The music is in C# minor.

#### measure 2

30 35 38 30 35 38 30 35 38 30 35 38

Very similarly with measure 2. The only change is in the LH which now plays octave B: 13-23. Measure 3 gets a bit more interesting: it changes the mood to A major (31-35-38) and then D major (31-36-3x). 

#### measure 3
~~~~
31 35 38 31 35 38 31 36 3x 31 36 3x
21                1x
11                0x

Then back to C# minor and subdues to begin a new development in measure 5.

#### measure 4
~~~~
30 34 3x 30 35 38 30 35 37 2x 34 37
20                20

Note that use of a unstable chord at the end there as (2x 34 37) = C _diminished_. It signals the end of introduction.

You can try to memorize hand separately (HS) before playing hand together (HT). But once you know how to [map the number to piano keys](/basics/mapping-piano-keys), this part should be easy enough to learn within 15 minutes to under an hour or so.
