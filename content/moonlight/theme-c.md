After a quick revisit of the [main theme](/moonlight/theme-a) with only 5 measures from 23-27, Beethoven then leads us to a long development (theme C) for the next 14 measures (18-41). This is my favourite section. We can divide it into 3 small parts for easier consumption:

__part C.1 (mm 28-31)__

Remember we cut the first chord from measure 28 because it actually belongs to [the last section](/moonlight/theme-a-revisited), therefore we progressively borrow the beginning chord of the next measure until measure 32 below.

__part C.2 (mm 32-37)__

Measure 41 brings the end of theme C, we are about to revive the main theme A in seconds. For now, we deserve a tea break!
