After the short introduction (first 4 measures), Beethoven immediately introduces the main theme:

Let's slow down and play this "signature" melody correctly: it is the last triplet of measure 5 combined with the first octave of measure 6. Below only shows the right hand notes:

_measure 5/6 (RH)_

The above signature theme (which is in C# minor) will be repeated through out the pieces many times in various flavours. So it is important to play it perfectly.

By measure 9, the music is in the key of E major (30-33-38) which modulates to E minor (2g-33-38) in measure 10:

As you begin to notice now, the "signature" theme is repeated again and again at the end of measure 10 and 11.

Measure 14 brings the end of theme A, we are about to enter theme B shortly.
