### Chapter 2

# Moonlight sonata

We will only learn the first movement of the [famous sonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)) by Beethoven. It is slow and its left hand use is very limited, making this one of the most suitable piece to play for beginner. I always recommend new comer to learn this piece first because of its simplicity and beauty.

This movement has a total of 69 measures. We will break this down into 8 small chunks for easier learning.
