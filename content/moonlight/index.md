### Chapter 2

# Moonlight sonata

We will only learn the [first movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT7_IZPHHb0) of the [famous sonata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)) by Beethoven. It is slow and its left hand use is very limited, making this one of the most suitable piece to play for beginner. I always recommend new comer to learn this piece first because of its simplicity and beauty.

This movement has a total of 69 measures. We will break this down into 8 small chunks for easier learning. The whole piece is marked as _cond Ped_, which means to keep the sustain pedal down while playing. But we can leave the pedal out while practice to reduce noise.

In the next sections, we will use the [Express Stave music sheet](/moonlight/ES_Beethoven_Moonlight.pdf) version to convert the notes to numbers. If you do not know how to read [ES music notation](http://musicnotation.org/system/express-stave-by-john-keller/), please have a look [here](/pdf/ESINTRO-p1.pdf).
