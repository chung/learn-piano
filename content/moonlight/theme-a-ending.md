After revisiting theme B, it is now time to go back home: to the main theme A for the last 10 measures (60-69). Note the interesting use of lower notes G# (20) in the left hand to replace for the higher notes G# (40) that were found in the [main theme](/moonlight/theme-a) at measures 5-7. It creates a fading effect: the moon slowly moves far away and eventually disappears over the horizon.

Measure 69 ended with C# minor. We are back home. And that is the end of the first movement.
