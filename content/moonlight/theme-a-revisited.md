After theme B, Beethoven quickly revisits the main theme A for the next 5 measures (23-27):

Let's slow down and play this "signature" melody again: it is the last triplet of measure 23 combined with the first octave of measure 24. Below only shows the right hand notes:

This time it is in the key F# minor (3x-41-45).

Notice that at the end of measure 27, we add the beginning chord (10-20-44) from measure 28 to end this section (theme A revisited) here. Next is theme C which is quite long development of 14 measures from 28-41.
