The decimal numeral system (base 10) is widely used today. However, historically, units of time in many civilizations are duodecimal (base 12). According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal):

_The number twelve, a superior highly composite number, is the smallest number with four non-trivial factors (2, 3, 4, 6), and the smallest to include as factors all four numbers (1 to 4) within the subitizing range. As a result of this increased factorability of the radix and its divisibility by a wide range of the most elemental numbers (whereas ten has only two non-trivial factors: 2 and 5, and not 3, 4, or 6), duodecimal representations fit more easily than decimal ones into many common patterns, as evidenced by the higher regularity observable in the duodecimal multiplication table. As a result, duodecimal has been described as the optimal number system._

Base 12 certainly fits well with clocks and pianos. In a duodecimal place system, twelve is written as 10, however there are numerous proposals how to write ten and eleven. For the purpose of learning piano, we will use _x_ or _X_ to write _ten_, and _g_ or _G_ to write _eleven_. So here is how to count in base 12:

~~~~
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 x g
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1x 1g
20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2x 2g
~~~~

With a bit of practice, we can count in base 12 as well as in base 10.
