### Chapter 1

# Piano basics

The piano has total 88 keys. But they are all repeats of 12 distinct keys: 5 black keys and 7 white keys. That pattern is easy to spot. Therefore it is natural to represent the piano keys with [duodecimal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal). We will start this chapter with learning how to [count in base 12](/basics/counting-base-12), then [mapping the piano keys](/basics/mapping-piano-keys) to the base 12 numbers, and finally understand a bit of [musical theory](/basics/basic-musical-theory) to be able to start learning beautiful piano pieces quickly.
