We will learn just enough musical theory to get us started as quick as possible with actually learning to play some beautiful piano pieces like the [Moonlight sonata](/moonlight/).
In this page, you will only learn major, minor, diminished and augmented chords. But before that, we need to learn intervals.

## Intervals

As you should know by now, the piano has 88 independent keys, identified by number from 1 to 74 in [base 12](/basics/counting-base-12). However, because of repetitions, there are only 12 distinct keys. In the same way as in English, pronouncing 26 alphabet letters does not make a fascinating story, playing each of these 12 notes alone will not be much interesting. Only through combining these notes together in a special way that _music_ is created. In fact, if we take a piece of music and shift all the notes to the left or to the right by the same distance (transpose), we would still preserve the _melody_ of it. So what is important is the interval between notes.

Let say we have 2 notes: 31 and 34 (which through the [mapping](/basics/mapping-piano-keys), we know it stands for note A & C), the interval is just the substraction of them: 34 - 31 = 3.

## Major and minor chords

A major chord is any three notes n1, n2, n3 such that n2 - n1 = 4 & n3 - n2 = 3. Whereas minor chord: n2 - n1 = 3 & n3 - n2 = 4.

For example: 31 34 38 is a minor chord. And since 31(A) is the lowest note, we call it chord: A minor. So A minor chord consists of 31=A, 34=C and 38=E.

Similarly, 31 35 38 is A major chord, which consists of 31(A), 35(C#) and 38(E).

~~~~
4:3 = major
3:4 = minor
~~~~

Because one side of the intervals is longer than the other (4 > 3), so major and minor chords are stable. Imagine a [lever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever) with one side is heavier than the other, so it is _stable_ in the sense that it is definitely leaning towards that heavier side.

## Diminished and augmented chords

As defined above, 4:3 intervals = major and 3:4 = minor. We have two more chords:

~~~~
3:3 = diminished
4:4 = augmented
~~~~

For example: (33 36 39) = B diminished chord, or B _dim_ for short.
(34 38 40) = C augmented chord, or C+ for short.

Because both sides of the intervals are balance (3 = 3 or 4 = 4), therefore diminished and augmented chords have unstable sounds.


That is it. If music is a language, then 12 notes are the alphabet, and major, minor, diminished and augmented chords are the basic vocabularies. We simply need to master these before moving on.
